# BERT Spam Email Detection

This repository contains a project that utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to detect spam emails. The goal is to build a robust email classifier that leverages BERT's deep understanding of language to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails.

## Project Overview

In this project, we fine-tune a BERT model using the `transformers` library for sequence classification. The model is trained on a labeled email dataset and is capable of classifying emails into two categories: spam or not spam. The project includes pre-processing steps, tokenization, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

### Key Features:
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model using the `TFBertForSequenceClassification` from Hugging Face's Transformers library.
- Tokenizing the email text using `BertTokenizer`.
- Evaluation using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
- Cosine similarity computation to assess feature similarity between emails.
- Visualizing results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used:
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the BERT model.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: To access pre-trained models (if required).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For splitting the dataset, computing cosine similarity, and evaluating the model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: For visualizing confusion matrix and other plots.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating graphs and plots.
- **Transformers**: For tokenizing email text and loading the pre-trained BERT model.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BERT-Spam-Email-Detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd BERT-Spam-Email-Detection

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the Bertspamemail.ipynb file to start the training process.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled emails (spam and non-spam). It is pre-processed to remove unnecessary characters and tokenize the text for input into the BERT model.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and cosine similarity to measure the performance of the spam detection system. Visualization of results is done using Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate heatmaps and accuracy plots.

Results
After training, the model shows promising results in classifying spam emails with high accuracy and precision, reducing false positives and improving the detection of unwanted emails.
